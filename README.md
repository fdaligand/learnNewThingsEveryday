## Design Pattern 
### Law of Demeter (LoD)
>LoD is a specific case of loose coupling.
>The motto is **"Only talk to your immediate friends"**.
>It can be summarized in following ways : 
> * Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
> * Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers
> * Only talk to your immediate friends.
