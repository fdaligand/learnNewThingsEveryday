# Clean code

> Robert C. Martin
Lean methods apply to code.

*Small things matter*, *God is in the details*  
In software, 80% or more of what we do is quaintly called
“maintenance”: the act of repair.  
In sotftware, focus on maintenance before on production.
5s:
 * *Seiri* (sort, organisation) => suitable naming  
 * *Seiton* (systematize) => code should be at palce that we expect to be
 * *Seiso* (shine, clean) => sanitize your code (no boller plate comments, ...)
 * *Seiketsu* (standardization) => how to get the workplace clean
 * *Shutsuke* (self-disciplien) => disciplien to follow the practice

Making your code readable is as important as making it executable.  
You should name a variable using the same care with which you
name a first-born child.
